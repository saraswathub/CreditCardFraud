# CreditCardFraud


Credit card firms must detect fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent consumers from being charged for products they did not buy. Data Science can address such a challenge, and its significance, coupled with Machine Learning, cannot be emphasized.

The dataset utilized covers credit card transactions done by European cardholders in September 2013. This dataset contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions over two days. The dataset is unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172 percent of all transactions.
